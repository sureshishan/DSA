To find the depth (or height) of a binary tree, we use recursion (DFS - Depth First Search).

The depth of a binary tree is the number of edges from the root node to the deepest leaf node.
If a tree has only one node (root), its depth is 0.
If the tree is empty (null), its depth is -1 (or 0 in some conventions).
