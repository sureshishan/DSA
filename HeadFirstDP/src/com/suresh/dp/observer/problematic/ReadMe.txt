Issues with this approach:

Tight Coupling:
---------------
The WeatherData class is tightly coupled to specific observer implementations (CurrentConditionsDisplay and StatisticsDisplay).
Adding a new observer requires modifying the WeatherData class, violating the Open/Closed Principle.

Limited Extensibility:
----------------------
You cannot dynamically add or remove observers. All observers must be passed in the constructor or hardcoded.

Poor Reusability:
-----------------
Observers cannot be reused with another subject, as they depend on the specific implementation of WeatherData.


Violation of Single Responsibility Principle:
---------------------------------------------
The WeatherData class is responsible for both managing weather data and notifying observers, leading to a mix of concerns.

Manual Notification:
--------------------
The subject (WeatherData) directly calls update() on each observer. This requires explicit knowledge of all observers, making the code rigid.
